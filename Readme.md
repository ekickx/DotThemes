## What is this? ðŸ¤”

I use this repo for managing my configuration, such as **XFCE**, **Openbox**, **AwesomeWM**, etc in pack. So basically it's for storing config on specific theme. And for general configuration, like keybinding, I store it on [myDotfiles](github.com/ekickx/myDotfiles) repo. Btw, This repo is inspired by [reorr's repo](https://github.com/reorr/my-theme-collection).

## Want to use it?

**Clone this repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekickx/MyThemeCollection.git
cd MyThemeCollection/
```

**Deploy theme**

```bash
./.deploy.sh <themename>
