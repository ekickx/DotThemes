# What is this?

I use this repo for manage my theme collection. I use this repo, instead of [my Dotfiles repo](https://github.com/ekickx/Dotfiles) for managing theme because I find it easier. I use this repo for my theme only and dotfile for other configuration. Btw, I'm inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/reorr/my-theme-collection).

# Want to use it?

Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekickx/MyThemeCollection.git
cd MyThemeCollection/
```

Deploy theme

```bash
./deploy.sh <themename>
```
